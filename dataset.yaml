# YOLO Dataset Configuration for Drone Detection  
# 6-class custom dataset: bird, dog, cat, motorcycle, car, truck

# Dataset paths (relative to this file)
path: .
train: train/images
val: val/images

# Number of classes (sequential IDs 0-5, but mapped to COCO classes)
nc: 6

# Class names mapped to COCO equivalents for better transfer learning
# Sequential IDs required by YOLO, but ordered to match COCO importance
names:
  0: car        # Maps to COCO ID 2
  1: motorcycle # Maps to COCO ID 3  
  2: truck      # Maps to COCO ID 7
  3: bird       # Maps to COCO ID 14
  4: cat        # Maps to COCO ID 15
  5: dog        # Maps to COCO ID 16
